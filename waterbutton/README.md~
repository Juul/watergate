Firmware for the button that sends HTTP requests to the solenoid valve controller.

# Install dependencies

First, install [arduino-cli](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/0.35/installation/) which you probably already have if you previously compiled the solenoid controller firmware.

Then:

```
# update list of installable platforms, addin ESP32
arduino-cli core update-index --additional-urls https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json

# install core for ESP32
arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32
```

Now do:

```
cp settings.mk.example settings.mk
```

Then edit `settings.mk` to fit your system. You can get the serial device for the currently connected dev board like so:

```
arduino-cli board list
```

# Compile

```
make compile
```

# Upload

```
make upload
```

You can also upload and compile in one go like so:

```
make
```

# Monitor

To see the debug output:

```
make monitor
```

# Usage

It uses DHCP to get an IP. The MAC address can be found at the top of watergate.ino

It runs a web server so control is via HTTP.

A simple control web page exists at http://<IP>/ but is mostly for testing.

## /sf/on/<n>

Turn the water on for <n> number of minutes where <n> is a positive integer.

## /sf/off

Turn the water off.

## /sf/on/w

Turn the water on for 1 minute the first time.

If there is at least 30 seconds remaining on the timer and this is hit again then turn it on for 5 minutes (not 5 extra minutes but exactly 5 minutes).

If there is at least 4 minutes remaining on the timer and this is hit again then turn it on for 20 minutes (not 20 extra minutes but exactly 20 minutes).
