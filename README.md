Uses an Arduino Uno R3 and Arduino Ethernet Shield V1.1 (ENC28J60) for the solenoid valve controller.

Uses a wifi-connected ESP32 for the button that sends request to the solenoid valve controller.

The firmware for the solenoid valve controller is in `watergate/`

The firmware for the button is in `waterbutton/`
